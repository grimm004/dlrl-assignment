Figure~\ref{fig:best-batch} shows the best batch of 64 images:
While most of the samples are very noisy, a horse-like shape can be seen in some samples, and a bird-like shape in others.

Of this batch however, the most Pegasus-like image is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:best-image}.
It has a light colour and, with some imagination, looks like it is flying (with its head in the top left, wings at the top and legs at the bottom).
